# AegisAir: Complete Development Walkthrough

All major, finalized changes organized into phases of development.

---

## Phase 1 — Interactive 3D Molecule Viewer
**Component:** Hero Section (`#hero`)
- Auto-cycle through Propane, Butane, CO2, and CO every 4 seconds.
- Manual button click resets the cycle timer without breaking the loop.

---

## Phase 2 — Problem Section: Data & Layout
**Component:** Problem Section (`#problem`)
- Replaced placeholder text with verified India-specific LPG statistics:
  - **6,700+** cylinder accidents (2016–2024, OMC)
  - **330M+** LPG connections with near-zero smart detection
  - **~825** incidents/year (Lok Sabha, 2019)
- Styled as a horizontal stat row with gradient numbers and monospace labels.
- Retained the floating glass-card layout with centered content.

---

## Phase 3 — Orbital Hub Branding
**Component:** Orbital Integration Hub (`#orchestra`)
- Added a `THE PLATFORM` label and a bold `4rem` "AegisAir" heading (gradient on "Air") before the descriptive paragraph.

---

## Phase 4 — Features Grid Refinement
**Component:** Features Section (`#features`)
- All cards default to dark glass and turn solid accent on hover only (no permanent highlights).
- Hover shows: background fill, `-5px` translate, text `scale(1.03)`, text turns white.
- All card text is left-aligned across the entire grid.
- `grid-auto-rows: minmax(140px, auto)` — cards wrap tightly around content.
- "Intelligent Hazard Detection" changed from `span-2x2` to `span-2` (two columns, one row) to eliminate vertical whitespace.

## Phase 5 — Full White Theme Reskin
**Scope:** Global (`style.css` + `index.html`)

Complete visual overhaul from dark navy to a clean white-first interface.

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| Background | `#FFFFFF` |
| Accent (Green) | `#21DB52` |
| Text / Structure | `#383735` |
| Glass card | `background: #FFFFFF`, `border: 1px solid rgba(56,55,53,0.12)` |
| Glow | `0 0 35px rgba(33,219,82,0.25)` |

- Background grid uses dark dot lines instead of faint white lines.
- Hero glow radial gradient uses green instead of blue.
- Molecule viewer card uses a white/green glow instead of the dark gradient.
- All orbital ring nodes glow green.
- Footer uses charcoal background for contrast.

## Phase 6 — Visual Hierarchy & Surface System
**Scope:** `style.css`

A three-depth-layer architecture was applied to prevent the white base from feeling flat.

| Layer | Role | Style |
|---|---|---|
| Layer 1 | Base canvas | `#FFFFFF`, no borders |
| Layer 2 | Section surfaces | `rgba(56,55,53,0.03)` with `border-radius: 2rem` |
| Layer 3 | Cards / UI panels | `#FFFFFF`, `border: 1px solid`, `box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)` |

**Additional changes:**
- Section spacing increased to `9rem` (~140px) between sections.
- Button hover: `translateY(-2px)` + green glow (no more scale).
- Labels changed to `rgba(56,55,53,0.55)` — green restricted to data/actions only.
- Floating animation standardized to `8s ease-in-out infinite`.
- Orbit ring rotation: inner `80s`, middle `100s`, outer `120s` — very slow and environmental.
- All transitions normalized to `0.25s ease`.

## Phase 7 — Version Control
- Remote set to `https://github.com/Js-json/Aegis-Landing`
- All phases committed and pushed to `main`.
